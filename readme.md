- **HACS**: Any version
- **Python**: 3.10+ (handled by Home Assistant)

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: HACS (Recommended)

1. **Add Custom Repository**:
   - Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
   - Go to **Integrations** → **⋮** (menu) → **Custom repositories**
   - Add URL: `https://github.com/aarooh/hacs-tankille`
   - Category: **Integration**
   - Click **Add**

2. **Install Integration**:
   - Search for "**Tankille**" in HACS
   - Click **Download**
   - **Restart Home Assistant**

3. **Add Integration**:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration**
   - Search for "**Tankille**" and select it

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/aarooh/hacs-tankille/releases)
2. Extract and copy the `custom_components/tankille` directory to your Home Assistant installation's `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Add the integration via Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. **Navigate to Integration Setup**:
   - Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration
   - Search for "Tankille"

![01-add-integration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/266cf3fe-bed0-49c8-9c6c-60397f21e656)

2. **Enter Credentials and Configure Filtering**:

![02-login-and-location-setup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62ade903-91e6-4ef9-9a78-d2b0974e8b0b)


> **💡 Pro Tips**: 
> - Always use location filtering to avoid creating hundreds of sensors!
> - Use 2-5 km radius in cities, 10-15 km in rural areas
> - Add specific stations by name to include favorites outside your radius
> - Select only fuel types you actually use to reduce sensor count

### 🆕 Reconfigure After Setup

You can modify **all settings** after initial setup:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Find your Tankille integration
3. Click **Configure**
4. Modify any settings (location, station names, ignored chains, fuel types, etc.)
5. Integration automatically reloads with new settings

### Supported Fuel Types

| Fuel Code | Display Name | Default Enabled |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| `95` | 95E10 | ✅ |
| `98` | 98E5 | ✅ |
| `98+` | 98 Premium | ❌ |
| `dsl` | Diesel | ✅ |
| `dsl+` | Diesel Premium | ❌ |
| `ngas` | Natural Gas | ❌ |
| `bgas` | Biogas | ❌ |
| `85` | E85 | ❌ |
| `hvo` | HVO Diesel | ❌ |

*Note: Less common fuel types are disabled by default but can be enabled during setup or in options.*

### 🆕 Gas Station Chain Filtering

Filter out unwanted gas stations by entering chain names:

**Examples:**
- `"Neste"` - Filters all Neste stations (Neste, Neste Express, Neste Automat)
- `"ABC, K-Market"` - Filters ABC and K-Market stations  
- `"Shell, St1, Teboil"` - Filters multiple chains
- `"Express"` - Filters all Express stations regardless of parent company

**How it works:**
- Checks station **name**, **brand**, and **chain** fields
- Uses partial matching (substring search)
- Case insensitive matching
- Comma-separated list for multiple chains

### 🆕 Station Names - Include Specific Stations

Add specific gas stations by name, even if they're outside your location radius:

**Examples:**
- `"Shell Vantaa"` - Includes any Shell station in Vantaa
- `"Neste Espoo, St1 Tampere"` - Includes specific stations in multiple cities
- `"Express, Automat"` - Includes all Express and Automat stations regardless of location
- `"Shell Kamppi, ABC Leppävaara, Neste Airport"` - Mix of specific station locations

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Check the **Tankille mobile application** to see the exact station names and brands available in your area. The app shows the same station data that this integration uses, making it easier to find the correct names to include.

**How it works:**
- Searches through **all available stations** (not limited by location filter)
- Matches against station **name** and **brand** fields
- Uses partial matching (substring search) and case insensitive
- Comma-separated list for multiple stations
- **Combines with location filtering**: Gets stations within radius PLUS named stations outside radius
- **Deduplication**: Avoids creating duplicate sensors if a station matches both location and name criteria

**Use Cases:**
- Include your favorite station that's slightly outside your location radius
- Monitor specific stations along your commute route
- Track prices at stations near your workplace or frequent destinations
- Include a station with consistently good prices even if it's far away

**Combined Filtering Example:**
- **Location Filter**: 5km radius around Helsinki city center
- **Station Names**: "Shell Vantaa, Neste Airport"
- **Result**: All stations within 5km of Helsinki center + Shell Vantaa + Neste Airport (even if they're outside the 5km radius)

- `time_ago`: Relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago")
- `total_fuel_types`: Number of fuel types available
- `available_fuel_types`: List of fuel types

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ❌ Authentication Problems

**Issue**: Login fails with correct credentials
```yaml
# Solutions:
1. Verify credentials work in Tankille mobile app
2. Check Home Assistant logs for specific error
3. Try removing and re-adding the integration
4. Enable debug logging (see below)
```

**Issue**: "No stations found"
```yaml
# Solutions:
1. Verify your Tankille account has access to station data
2. Check location filtering settings
3. Try increasing search radius
4. Disable location filtering temporarily
```

#### 🌐 Connection Issues

**Issue**: "Cannot connect to Tankille API"
```yaml
# Solutions:
1. Check internet connectivity from HA
2. Verify api.tankille.fi is accessible
3. Check for firewall blocking HTTPS requests
4. Review HA network configuration
```

#### 📊 Data Issues

**Issue**: Missing or outdated prices
```yaml
# Solutions:
1. Check if data is available in Tankille mobile app
2. Adjust scan interval (minimum 30 minutes recommended)
3. Verify station is still operational
4. Check entity states in Developer Tools
```

#### 🆕 Filtering Issues

**Issue**: Stations not being filtered correctly
```yaml
# Solutions:
1. Check spelling of chain names in ignored list
2. Use partial names (e.g., "Neste" instead of "Neste Express")
3. Check logs for debug messages about filtered stations
4. Verify station names in entity attributes
```

**Issue**: Station names not being found
```yaml
# Solutions:
1. Check spelling of station names (partial matching is supported)
2. Try using brand names instead (e.g., "Shell" instead of "Shell Express Kamppi")
3. Use shorter, more generic terms (e.g., "Vantaa" to find all stations in Vantaa)
4. Check debug logs to see what stations were found by name search
5. Verify station exists in Tankille database via their mobile app
6. **💡 Use the Tankille mobile app to browse available stations and copy exact names**
```

**Issue**: Too many stations being included by name search
```yaml
# Solutions:
1. Use more specific search terms (e.g., "Shell Kamppi" instead of "Shell")
2. Use exact location names (e.g., "Neste Vantaa Myyrmäki" instead of "Neste")
3. Combine with ignored chains to filter out unwanted results
4. Check entity registry to disable unwanted sensors manually
```

**Issue**: Too many fuel type sensors
```yaml
# Solutions:
1. Reconfigure integration and select fewer fuel types
2. Disable unwanted sensors in entity registry
3. Use ignored chains to filter out unwanted stations
4. Be more specific with station names to reduce station count
```

### Debug Logging

Add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.tankille: debug
    custom_components.tankille.tankille_client: debug
```

### Advanced Debugging

1. **Check Entity Registry**: 
   - Developer Tools → States
   - Filter by `sensor.` and search for your station names

2. **Review Integration Logs**:
   - Settings → System → Logs
   - Search for "tankille"

3. **Test API Connectivity**:
   ```bash
   # From HA container/host
   curl -I https://api.tankille.fi
   ```
